D: *on the phone* So, daughter wants me to meet her new boyfriend. Let me tell you, I don't like the sound of this guy.
Unemployed? In a band? *scoffs* No sir, this fella better shape up if he wants to be with my daughter. 
*knock on door*
D: Oh dear me! That must be them now, I have to go. Goodbye! *hangs up phone* *walks up to door* *clears throat*
Dau: Hey daddy! This is Scruffy, my new boyfriend!
D: *hugs Dau while maintaining intimidating eye contact with Scruffy*
S: Hello sir. My name is Scruffy, I'm going out with your daughter.
D: *mutters under breath aside to himself* Maybe for now, ya bozo.
Dau: Come on in, Scruffy! Dad, did you make some bacon jam stroganoff?
D: Yeah, yeah I did. I'll set the table.
S: May I help, sir?
D: No. *shakes head for a moment longer than usual heads shake* No, just sit down.
Dau: Daaad!
D: *throws up his hands in exasperation and rolls his eyes* Aw, geez, alright. Come on fella.
D: *exits to kitchen*
Dau: *to Scruffy* So, what do you think?
S: *sighs* He hates me.
Dau: No he doesn't!
S: He thinks I'm just some buster brown that walked in from the garbage plant on his way to *scoffs* Loser Lane.
Dau: Oh come on, now. He'll warm up to you!
S: *aside to himself* Yeah, maybe by throwing me in the oven with the stroganoff! *canned laughter*
Dau: Come on, you know you aren't a bozo.
S: He sure thinks so. *eyebrows knit to his hairline in exasperation* Did you tell him yet?
Dau: No, he doesn't know yet.
S: So he doesn't know that *whispers* I have adult onset Asthma?
Dau: No, I'm waiting to tell him.
S: Daughter of D, this is serious. Are you waiting for him to find out?! How? By me in an asthmatic rage, killed from his
lack of preparedness by possessing a inhaler?
D:*from kitchen* The tables set. *walks in and looks at Scruffy* No thanks to you. *spits at Scruffy's feet* *goes back
into the kitchen.
Dau: *shrugs*
